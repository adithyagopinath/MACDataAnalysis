The deliverables attached are the Jupyter Notebook and associated datasets. An HTML file is attached for sharing, which does not require any software to read the code.

The Jupyter Notebook has been organized so anyone can read it, meaning there is background information at the beginning and an explanation for the necessary visuals and code.

Other Notes:
Some display() code has been commented on instead of being removed as they are useful to look at. The reason they have been commented is for readability purposes.
