# MACDataAnalysis
The deliverables attached are the Jupyter Notebook and associated datasets. An HTML file is attached for sharing, which does not require any software to read the code. If software is used to view Notebook such as VSCode, make sure that the folder with all datasets and notebook is set as the directory (otherwise code won't work). In addition, running all will provide the output, but if you decide to run individual cells after running all, some individual cells may produce errors due to the data being mutated. Because of this, make sure to Run All.

The Jupyter Notebook has been organized so anyone can read it, meaning there is background information at the beginning and an explanation for the necessary visuals and code. The organization of the notebook is below. 
1. Introduction
2. Background Information for Apprenticeships & Locally Sourced Food
3. Code Preparation (Importing libraries & pip install)
4. Maryland Apprenticeships Analysis
5. Workforce Data Analysis
6. Maryland Farms Analysis
7. Food Atlas Analysis


Other Notes:
Some display() code has been commented on instead of being removed as they are useful to look at. The reason they have been commented on is for readability purposes. 
The libraries that were used were pandas (reading datasets), numpy (for descriptive analysis), and matplotlib (for visualizations).
